I wanted to master my matplotlib skills in a quite bizarre way: by drawing pictures, to be precise. I believe that a need to draw some very specific lines will create challenges that may be hard to find in a real data analytics project.

In this project I am drawing a cat, a house and a tree in matplotlib.

In this project I realized that drawing in matplotlib requires not only understanding of various functions of the package - math skills are also a must. I used concepts that I did not expect from myself. I also had the opportunity to actively use my imagination, thus receiving much joy and happiness from the process.
