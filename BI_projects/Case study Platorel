**Scenario**
Elpen Pharmaceuticals has recently announced the launch of a new product called Platorel into the “Lipid modifying agents” market and they requested us the possibility to monitor the general trend of that market and the performance of the new launch.  

The client’s requirement is to have the analysis at:
-	brand level for the product dimension;
-	area level for the territory dimension;
-	drill-down capability Year -> Quarter -> Month for the time dimension.
They also would like to see some important metrics that could be derived and that can show the dynamic of the market, for example the value sales (pay attention, values not UNITS), the market share and the Evolution Index (see tips below). In addition, they are of course interested in discovering the result of the launch.
The Market definition is a market where the performance of each of a company’s products is evaluated against its competitors.

The Market share represents the % ratio of a product Sales to the total market sales. The formula is: (Product / Total Market *100).
The Evolution Index represent the Product growth vs Market Growth. The formula is: ((100 + Product Growth%) / (100 + Market Growth%)) x 100.
